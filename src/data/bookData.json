            "Super Methane Brothers is a video game similar to Taito's Bubble Bobble arcade game, released for Amiga in 1993 by Apache Software.",
            "The protagonists of the game, Puff and Blow, each have a Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas.",
            "If this comes into contact with a bad guy, he will be absorbed into the gas and then float around the screen for a limited time.",
            "Bad guys are harmless in this state.",
            "Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical surface.",
            "Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected."
